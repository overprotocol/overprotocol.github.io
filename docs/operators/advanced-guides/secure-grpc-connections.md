This document will help advanced users create and configure TLS certificates to allow for secure gRPC connections to their beacon nodes.
:::tip
The only practical use for using secure gRPC is in the case of connecting a beacon node that is being hosted remotely. For configurations in which the beacon node and validator reside on the same host system, these steps are not required nor recommended.
:::
A beacon node, by default, hosts a gRPC server on host 127.0.0.1 and port 4000, allowing any other process, such as a validator client, to establish an insecure connection on that port. The beacon node can also allow for secure, TLS connections if ran with the `--tls-cert=/path/to/cert.pem` and `--tls-key=/path/to/cert.key` flags, ensuring all connections via gRPC are secured.

A validator client will attempt to connect to a beacon node by default with an insecure connection, but can be a secure TLS connection by using a `--tls-cert=/path/to/cert.pem` flag, utilising either a server pem certificate or a `ca.cert` certificate authority file. Assuming a TLS certificate has already been set up with a trusted authority for your beacon node, use the commands below to launch the node and validator. Otherwise, review the following section on creating your own self-signed certificates.

To use secure gRPC with a beacon node:
```bash
beacon-node --tls-cert=server.pem --tls-key=server.key
```
and to use secure gRPC with a validator:
```bash
validator --tls-cert=server.pem
```
Alternatively, a `ca.cert` certificate authority file can be passed to the validator to attempt a connection without requiring the server's certificate itself:
```bash
validator --tls-cert=ca.cert
```
This will generate an output like so:
```bash
[2024-12-07 00:04:34]  INFO validator: Established secure gRPC connection
```

# Generating self-signed TLS certificates
> **NOTICE**: Creating a self-signed certificate is fine for simple TLS connections, though if the deployment will see public usage, it is always recommended to obtain valid certificates from a trusted certificate authority instead.

1. Install [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/) for your operating system.

2. Create a root signing key:
```bash
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 4096
```
3. Create a self-signed root certificate
```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -key ca.key -sha256 -subj "/C=US/ST=NJ/O=CA, Inc." -days 365 -out ca.cert
```
4. Create a key certificate for the beacon node:
```bash
openssl genrsa -out beacon.key 4096
```
5. Generate a signing CSR by first creating a certificate.conf configuration file containing the specifications. For reference, you can use something as follows with any of its fields customized to your needs:

```bash
[req]
default_bits = 4096
prompt = no
default_md = sha256
req_extensions = req_ext
distinguished_name = dn
[dn]
C = US
ST = NJ
O = Test, Inc.
CN = localhost
[req_ext]
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = localhost
IP.1 = ::1
IP.2 = 127.0.0.1
```
6. Generate the signing CSR:

```bash
openssl req -new -key beacon.key -out beacon.csr -config certificate.conf
```
7. Generate a certificate for the beacon node:

```bash
openssl x509 -req -in beacon.csr -CA ca.cert -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out beacon.pem -days 365 -sha256 -extfile certificate.conf -extensions req_ext
```

8. Verify your certificate is correct with openssl:
```bash
openssl x509 -in beacon.pem -text -noout
```
This will generate an output like so:

```json
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 12510557889986420634 (0xad9e6e1dfe99df9a)
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: C=US, ST=NJ, O=CA, Inc.
        Validity
            Not Before: Jun 15 21:12:24 2020 GMT
            Not After : Jun 15 21:12:24 2021 GMT
        Subject: C=US, ST=NJ, O=Test, Inc., CN=localhost
        Subject Public Key Info:
            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption
                Public-Key: (4096 bit)
```
# Using the new certificates
1. Use the certificates to launch the beacon node:
```bash
beacon-node --tls-cert=beacon.pem --tls-key=beacon.key
```
2. As well as a validator:
```bash
validator --tls-cert=ca.cert
```
This will generate an output like so:

```bash
[2024-12-07 00:05:12]  INFO validator: Established secure gRPC connection
```
